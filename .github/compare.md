**Objective:** Analyze and compare the provided project(s) to generate and execute a strategic plan for merging them into a single, superior version.

**Default Scope:** If no specific files, folders, or projects are provided as input, target all projects within the current workspace.

### Phase 1: Analysis

For each project, perform a comprehensive analysis and provide a structured review. Cover the following aspects:

1.  **Project Overview:** Purpose, primary features, and target audience.
2.  **Tech Stack:** Languages, frameworks, libraries, and databases.
3.  **Architecture:** Design patterns, directory structure, and data flow.
4.  **Scalability & Modularity:** How well the architecture supports growth, component independence, and upgrade paths.
5.  **Code Quality:** Readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
6.  **Security:** Analysis of potential vulnerabilities (e.g., via static analysis), dependency security, and secure coding practices.
7.  **UI/UX & Appeal:** Visual design, user experience, and "attention-attracting" features that enhance marketability.
8.  **Dependencies:** Key external dependencies and their versions.
9.  **Testing:** Test coverage, types of tests (unit, integration), and testing frameworks.
10. **Deployment:** Build process, CI/CD setup, and hosting environment.

### Phase 2: Comparative Report

Based on the analysis, generate a detailed side-by-side comparison of the projects. Use a table format for clarity where possible. Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each project across the categories from Phase 1.

### Phase 3: Strategic Merger Plan

Propose a detailed, actionable plan to create a single, unified project that incorporates the best features and practices from all analyzed projects. The plan must include:

1.  **Recommended Foundation:** Which project should serve as the base for the new version, and why.
2.  **Feature Integration:** A specific list of features to port from other projects.
3.  **Technical Consolidation:** A definitive choice for the final tech stack, architecture, and coding standards.
4.  **Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:** A clear sequence of tasks required to build the merged project.

### Phase 4: User Approval & Execution

1.  **Seek Approval:** Present the strategic plan to the user and ask for approval.
2.  **Handle Rejection:** If the user does not approve, ask if they want a revised plan or wish to provide specific edits. Await their feedback before proceeding.
3.  **Confirm Action:** Once the plan is approved, ask the user for the next step:
    *   **Option A: "Build"** - Begin creating the new, merged project.
    *   **Option B: "Save"** - Save the complete plan to a document.
4.  **Execute:**
    *   If **"Build"**: Create the new project in a new folder within a user-specified directory.
    *   If **"Save"**: Create a detailed markdown document containing the analysis, comparison, and final plan. Save it in a user-specified directory.
