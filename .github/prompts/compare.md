If no specific projects are provided as options, default to analyzing all projects present in the current workspace. Begin by performing a thorough and fully detailed analysis of each project, providing a comprehensive professional review that includes, but is not limited to: project objectives, architecture and design patterns, technologies and dependencies used, code quality (e.g., readability, efficiency, adherence to best practices), documentation completeness, testing coverage, scalability, security measures, performance metrics, potential bugs or vulnerabilities, integration points with other systems, user interface and experience details, licensing and compliance aspects, version control history, and any unique features or innovations. For each project, highlight strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, drawing on industry standards and best practices.

Next, provide a complete and fully detailed comparison of the projects to each other, covering similarities, differences, overlapping functionalities, complementary aspects, conflicting elements, and trade-offs. Use structured metrics such as feature sets, performance benchmarks, maintenance overhead, extensibility, and overall suitability for various use cases to facilitate an objective evaluation.

Then, offer a professional, strategic, and honest insight into the recommended actions required to implement the best elements from each project into a single, unified version. This should include a step-by-step plan with specifics such as: prioritization of features to merge (e.g., retaining superior UI from one and backend logic from another), refactoring strategies to resolve conflicts (e.g., harmonizing authentication methods or database schemas), integration techniques (e.g., using APIs or modular components), timelines for development phases, resource allocation (e.g., tools, team roles), risk assessments and mitigation plans, and validation methods (e.g., testing suites for the merged product). Ensure the insight emphasizes feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with long-term goals.

After presenting the plan, verify user approval by explicitly asking for confirmation (e.g., "Do you approve this plan to proceed?"). If they do not approve, inquire whether they would like an alternative plan generated or prefer to edit specific parts of the current plan, then iterate accordingly based on their response.

Once the plan is approved, ask if they would like to initiate the creation of the new, improved project version immediately or save the plan as a document for later use. If they choose to start creation, begin building the new project in a new folder within the workspace, inside the user-specified directory, following the approved plan's steps incrementally while providing progress updates. If they choose to save the plan, create a detailed document (e.g., in Markdown or PDF format) containing all reviews, comparisons, insights, and the full plan, saving it in the user-specified directory. In both cases, confirm successful completion and offer further assistance.
