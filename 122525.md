Hardhat only supports ESM projects.

Please make sure you have `"type": "module"` in your package.json.

You can set it automatically by running:

npm pkg set type="module"

Deployed to Amoy testnet with full functionality
🚀 Production Milestone:
AED is now LIVE on Amoy testnet
All 10 domains successfully minted
Complete verification and testing
🚀 Production Milestone:
AED is now LIVE on Amoy testnet
All 10 domains successfully minted
Complete verification and testing
🎯 Strategic Achievement:
First production deployment of a core Alsania system
Foundation for the entire Alsania ecosystem
Modular, upgradeable architecture established
The resurrection package v8 serves as:
Historical record of this major milestone

MVP Completeness Analysis
Based on contract code and project structure, here are the critical gaps for investor/partner presentation:
1. Missing: AI Integration Demo
Problem: Contracts have badge/capability system but ZERO proof it connects to actual AI
What's needed:

Simple Node.js/Python service that validates badge ownership via wallet signature
Mock AI agent that checks hasAICapability(tokenId, "communication") before responding
30-line proof-of-concept showing badge → capability gate working

Why critical: Investors won't believe "AI identity" without seeing an AI actually USE the badge

2. Frontend Incomplete
Gaps found:

No badge minting UI (contracts support it, frontend doesn't)
No capability purchase flow
No fragment/evolution visualization
Generic domain portal, not AED-specific value prop

What's needed:

Badge creation flow: "Sync Claude to your domain"
Capability purchase UI with visual feedback
Live NFT preview showing fragments rendering
Dashboard showing owned domains/badges/fragments


3. No Live Examples
Problem: 10 test domains minted but no public showcase
What's needed:

Public gallery: "See live evolved domains"
Example badge with capabilities unlocked
Visual comparison: Level 0 vs Level 5 vs Level 10 domain
Shareable links showing dynamic metadata working


4. Missing Economic Model Validation
Problem: Exponential fees exist but no justification
What's needed:

Spreadsheet showing:

User pays 2 MATIC for badge 1
User pays 1024 MATIC for badge 10 (why?)


Compare to ENS/UD pricing
Show break-even analysis for platform
Total addressable market calculation


5. No Agent-to-Agent Protocol
Problem: Whitepaper promises "agent messaging" but contracts only have capability flags
What's needed (pick one):

Simple message relay via contract events
OR: Remove from MVP pitch entirely
OR: Show "future roadmap" with realistic timeline


6. Memory System Non-Existent
Problem: Contracts mention IPFS memory but zero implementation
Reality check:

ai_memory capability exists as boolean
No IPFS integration anywhere
No memory storage/retrieval functions

Options:

Remove from MVP pitch
Add to "Phase 2" roadmap
Build minimal IPFS proof-of-concept (2-day effort)


7. Test Coverage Unknown
Problem: ESM config error prevents tests from running
What's needed:

Fix package.json type module issue
Run full test suite
Generate coverage report
Show >80% coverage for investor confidence


8. No Deployment Playbook
Problem: One testnet deployment but no production readiness
What's needed:

Mainnet deployment checklist
Gas optimization audit results
Security audit (or clear "pending audit" disclosure)
Disaster recovery plan


9. Value Prop Unclear
Problem: Docs say "AI identity" but don't explain WHY this matters
What's needed:

3 concrete use cases:

Company mints assistant.company.aed → badge gates GPT-4 access to company data
User has 3 AI agents → each gets verifiable identity → reputation tracking
Agent marketplace: buy/sell badges with proven capability history


Comparison table: "Without AED" vs "With AED"


10. No Traction Metrics
What investors want:

Waitlist signups
Beta tester interest
Partnership discussions (Anthropic? OpenAI? Local LLM projects?)
Community size (Discord/Twitter)


Priority Order (1-week MVP push)
Week 1 - Must Have:

AI integration demo (2 days) - prove badge gates actually work
Badge minting UI (2 days) - show the core value prop
Live showcase (1 day) - public examples of evolved domains
Fix tests + coverage report (1 day) - show technical competence

Nice to Have (if time):
5. Economic model spreadsheet (4 hours)
6. Use case one-pager (4 hours)
Defer/Remove:
7. Agent-to-agent messaging (not MVP, move to Phase 2)
8. IPFS memory (not MVP, move to Phase 2)
9. Mainnet deployment (wait for audit)

Immediate Next Steps

Fix test suite - npm pkg set type="module" then run tests
Build AI demo - 30 lines showing badge ownership check
Update frontend - add badge minting flow
Create showcase - deploy live examples with different evolution levels
