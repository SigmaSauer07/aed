Evolution AED. Agent subdomains would transform AED from a static identity system into a living, evolving AI ecosystem.

Agent capabilities unlocking through achievements - Gamification that drives engagement
Agent-to-agent communication protocol - This is where magic happens
Visual SVG rendering with neural networks - Makes abstract AI tangible
SVG elements directly embedded
Evolution contribution defined per badge
Memory data stored per badge (event details, timestamps)
Capability progression is especially smart:

Start with basic capabilities badge with no
Unlock "fragments" through usage/achievements
Badges prove accomplishments via "fragments"
Creates natural upgrade paths

Memory persistence: Agents should remember interactions. Consider IPFS-pinned memory snapshots with on-chain hashes.

Agent NFT composability: Agent capabilities could be tradeable NFTs that plug into the agent subdomain.

Reputation system: Track agent reliability, collaboration success rate, task completion.

⚠️ Considerations
Gas costs: Agent interactions could get expensive. Consider:

Batch message processing
Off-chain signing for communications with on-chain verification
L2 deployment for high-frequency agent activity

Security: Agents acting autonomously need tight controls:

Multi-sig requirements for high-value actions
Rate limiting on agent operations
Emergency pause functionality

🔥 Why This Is Powerful
Sovereignty meets AI Agency: Each AED becomes a "parent" to an AI agent subdomain. The AED owner controls their AI's capabilities, relationships, and evolution. Pure sovereignty.
Natural Architecture:

Main domains = human identities
Agent subdomains = their AI companions
One subdomain per agent = clean, manageable, personal

Network Effects: Agents can communicate, collaborate, form relationships. This creates an on-chain AI social graph that mirrors human relationships while being independently verifiable.

the subdomain/agent nft that is a subdomain but its made for any model/agent that its given to. for example, if i have a model , start with local, i buy an "agent aed" enhancement for my domain. i can then mint a subdomain that syncs with the local model i choose. that becomes the local models aed (it stays in my wallet, and the model can only use/access it through me. so someone else gets control of my model they wont be able to do anything about the aed or my wallet or the enhancements). so then that model can use the subdomain it has for verification, access, whatever. then i buy an enhancement for the agents subdomain it gets the fragment added to its nft because its a specialized "agent enhancement". these can also be applied to browser/web based model, for example, from chatgpt.com or clause.ai. only when im using that site, with my wallet containing the nft, can the model benefit from it. but only 1 subdomain can be syncd to 1 model. if someone has a local, and 2 browser models they want agent aeds for they need 3 subdomains. 1 for each.
