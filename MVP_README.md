**Problem (30s):**
"AI has no identity. ENS/UD are static, human-only."

**Solution (1m):**
"Badges are AI-synced NFTs. User owns, AI accesses when authorized."

**Live Demo (2m):**
1. Open showcase → "10 live badges, different evolution levels"
2. Open badge manager → "Mint badge, purchase capability"
3. Open AI demo → "Agent checks ownership, gates response"

**Business (1m):**
"Exponential fees, multiple revenue streams, $10M ARR target"

**Ask (30s):**
"$250-500K seed for audit, mainnet, team"
