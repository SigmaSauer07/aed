# Gas Optimizations and Dependency Standardization

## Dependency Standardization
- Updated OpenZeppelin contracts-upgradeable from v4.9.6 to v5.3.0 to match the standard contracts version
- Updated import paths to match the new OpenZeppelin v5.3.0 structure
- Ensured consistent dependency versions across the project

## Gas Optimizations

### CoreState.sol
- Optimized struct packing in the Domain struct to reduce storage slots
- Grouped similar data types together to optimize storage layout
- Added detailed comments explaining the storage layout optimization

### AEDRegistry.sol
- Changed feature flag functions to use uint256 instead of uint8 for more efficient operations
- Used storage pointers to avoid multiple SLOAD/SSTORE operations
- Changed string memory to string calldata for read-only parameters
- Optimized the isFreeTLD function with better gas practices
- Enhanced getSupportedTLDs function with pre-allocated memory arrays
- Improved _isValidFeature function for better gas efficiency

### AED.sol
- Optimized the initialize function by:
  - Using calldata instead of memory for string parameters
  - Combining multiple require statements
  - Grouping similar initializations together
  - Using unchecked blocks for arithmetic operations where overflow is impossible
- Optimized the updateSubdomainSettings function to reduce redundant operations
- Improved the _authorizeUpgrade function with a single storage operation
- Added a constant for the ERC2981 interface ID in supportsInterface
- Enhanced comments to explain gas optimization techniques

### General Optimizations
- Used unchecked blocks for arithmetic operations where overflow is impossible
- Replaced multiple storage reads/writes with local variables
- Changed memory to calldata for read-only function parameters
- Combined multiple require statements where appropriate
- Added detailed comments explaining gas optimization techniques

These optimizations should significantly reduce gas costs for contract deployment and function calls, making the system more efficient and cost-effective for users.
